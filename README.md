# Java Data Tracker

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description
This project allows a user to create datasets - univariate or bivariate - and decide whether to attach dates to the datapoints.  The user can also choose whether to make the dataset public.  Once the dataset is created and datapoints are added, the application will perform certain data analyses on the provided data.  The motivations behind the project were two-fold: to get practice using Java on the backend of an application and to create an application that would actually be useable in creating quick data analyses.  The project utilizes Java, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and MySQL.

## Installation

If the user wishes to use this program locally, he/she must have Java installed on his/her machine and an IDE to run the program (I use IntelliJ IDEA).  The user must also have MySQL installed on his her machine for database storage.  Once this is done, the user should clone the files in the project folder, and the application should work.

## Usage

Once the project is installed, the user should navigate to localhost:<port>, using whatever port he/she decided on which to run the program.  The user then can create an account and start creating datasets.  Alternatively, if the user wants to use the live version of the program, he/she just needs to navigate to it via the link provided elsewhere in this document.
